# Parametrized-FIR-Filter
FIR filters are is widely used in different applications such as biomedical, communication and control due to its easily implementation, stability and best performance. Its simplicity makes it attractive for many applications where it is need to minimize computational requirements. In this work, Parameterizing Bit-widths of Input/output and coefficients along with Length of an FIR Filter are studied.

## What is the maximum frequency at which your implementation can operate?
Max. Frequency for Question 1:
(Maximum Frequency: 962.232MHz) in case of Clockless Output
(Maximum Frequency: 131.735MHz) in case of Clocked Output
